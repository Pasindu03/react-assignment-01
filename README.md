## Project Overview
This project is a React-based assignment designed for learning and practicing React fundamentals. The assignment focuses on building a mock application with core React concepts, including components, state management, props, and event handling.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

## Getting Started
To get the project running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd react-assignment-mock
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Features
- **Dynamic Components:** Build reusable and modular React components.
- **State Management:** Implement local state using React hooks like `useState`.
- **Event Handling:** Handle user interactions like button clicks and form submissions.
- **Props Management:** Pass and manage props between components effectively.

## Scripts
Here are the scripts available for the project:

- `npm start` or `yarn start`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `npm test` or `yarn test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build` or `yarn build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run eject`: Removes the React scripts and configures the app manually (use with caution).
